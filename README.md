# What is Project Euler?
Project Euler is a website created back in 2001. It hosts a collection of around 600 different algorithm problems that get progressively harder, to the point where even people with math PhD's still struggle with them.

So I'm just going to try and do what I can. 

The original website supporting this is [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/) but I'm using the [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/projecteuler100-coding-challenge-competitive-programming/) version. 

Join me if you want. If I get stuck maybe you can help.
